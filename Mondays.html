        <p>It was just Friday afternoon, and we were shutting our laptops and beginning our weekends with a feeling of relief. But it was over as quickly as it began. Monday is back and, for most of us, we’re not really looking forward to heading back to work. But with the right attitude, you can make Mondays great again and start the week on a positive note. </p>


        <h3>1. PLAN MONDAY MORNING ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON</h3>
        <p>
            Do you often sit down at your desk after the weekend and overwhelmed by the number of tasks you need to accomplish during the upcoming week? It doesn’t have to be that way: get a head start and plan your Monday on Friday afternoon. How? First, by writing a general to-do list. Then assign the individual tasks to a specific day. You’ll see that the world looks a lot different when you are well-organized.
        </p>

        <h3>2. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM AND FIND THE SOLUTION</h3>
        <p>Are you one of those people who is always in a bad mood on Sunday evening because you have to wake up early the next morning? Let’s be honest: it’s all about the right attitude! Look for the cause of your Monday blues and find a solution fast. Pick up a good book, connect with a close friend, meditate or make a list of the things you are thankful for. Get your mind in a more positive place.</p>

        <h3>3. PREPARE YOUR LUNCHES FOR THE WEEK ON SUNDAY EVENING</h3>
        <p>Cooking can reduce stress so doing a little meal prep is a great way to spend your Sunday evening. It gets you thinking about the week ahead, and, if you already know all the tasty things you have planned for lunch, you’ll have something extra to look forward to every day of the week.</p>

        <h3>4. MUSIC MAKES YOUR HEART BEAT FASTER</h3>
        <p>
            “Six o’clock already, I was just in the middle of a dream…” Does this song by The Bangles sound familiar? 🙂 You can find lots of playlists on the internet to give you the right #MondayMotivation. Music makes everything easier!
        </p>

        <h3>5. DON’T START THE WEEK STRESSED</h3>
        <p>Try to develop a Monday ritual: make a delicious breakfast before starting your work day, go for a walk or do a short yoga session. The key is to try and avoid starting the new work week stressed and feeling chaotic. Before you check your emails, remember to look at the to-do list you wrote on Friday. What should you tackle first? Set Establish your priorities for the day and then begin to work through your list slowly and mindfully.</p>

        <h3>6. BE THANKFUL FOR EVERY SINGLE DAY</h3>
        <p>Monday, 6 a.m. Your alarm clock rings, and everything just…sucks. If you wake up finding it hard to think positively, then do some work to change your mindset. One thing you can do is write down ten things you are thankful for in your life right now. Showing gratitude for what you have  will help you see that there are so many things to be thankful for, all of which are more worthwhile places to focus your energy.</p>

        <h3>7. MAKE MONDAY YOUR FAVORITE DAY</h3>
        <p>What do you like about Mondays? Nothing? Then do something about it! Don’t just try to survive the first day of the week but look for something that will put a smile on your face in the evening. This can be a special meal you cook at home an episode of your favorite TV show or a standing phone date with your friends or family. Try to find something to look forward to and make Monday your favorite day of the week!</p>
